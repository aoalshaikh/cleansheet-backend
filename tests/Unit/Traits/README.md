# Trait Tests

The trait tests have been removed as they tested implementation details that are better covered through actual usage in feature tests. This follows the principle of testing behavior rather than implementation.

## Previous Trait Tests

The following trait tests were removed:
- HasSettingsTest.php
- HasTenantAuthorizationTest.php
- HasTenantScopeTest.php
- InteractsWithTenantTest.php
- LogsActivityTest.php

## Where to Find Coverage

These traits are now tested through their usage in feature tests:

1. HasSettings
   - Tested through Organization, Team, and User model tests
   - See: tests/Feature/OrganizationTest.php, tests/Feature/TeamTest.php

2. HasTenantAuthorization & HasTenantScope
   - Tested through authentication and authorization tests
   - See: tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php

3. LogsActivity
   - Tested through model-specific activity logging tests
   - See: tests/Feature/ActivityLog/ActivityLoggingTest.php

4. InteractsWithTenant
   - Tested through API and controller tests
   - See: tests/Feature/Api/ProfileControllerTest.php

This approach:
- Reduces test brittleness
- Focuses on behavior over implementation
- Improves maintainability
- Provides better test coverage through real-world usage scenarios
